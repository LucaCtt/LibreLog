# LibreLog: Accurate and Efficient Unsupervised Log Parsing Using Open-Source Large Language Models

This repo is a fork of the code of the paper "LibreLog: Accurate and Efficient Unsupervised Log Parsing Using Open-Source Large Language Models". I made the following changes to the original repo:

- Updated the parser to use Ollama instead of PyTorch;
- Exported the main classes and functions from the `libre_log` module;
- Added comments explaining what each part of the code does and how it works;
- Changed the names of the columns in the log dataframes for my use case;
- Removed all benchmark and unnecessary stuff;
- Renamed variables and functions to make the code more readable.
